The system combines Ollama for embeddings and language models with Qdrant as a high-performance vector store, allowing natural-language search across cyber-threat documents. It supports ingestion, chunking, semantic search, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), all running entirely in my homelab environment.</p> <p>The result is a lightweight but powerful threat-intel capability: I can query APT groups, TTPs, malware behaviour, and other security topics and get context-aware answers grounded in my own corpus of reports. Everything runs offline, uses free tooling, and is fully under my control. A practical foundation for an AI-assisted SOC workflow, CTI analysis, or automated threat-hunting assistant.</p> <p>I don't expect to get these to a highly functional (or stable) standard, but more understand the concepts and integration opportunities.</p>"},{"location":"malware/dynamic-basics/","title":"Dynamic Analysis Basics","text":"<p>Foundational dynamic analysis techniques.</p>"},{"location":"malware/environment/","title":"Environment Setup","text":"<p>Notes on Hypervisors and VMs: Proxmox, VirtualBox, Windows v Linux etc.</p>"},{"location":"malware/overview/","title":"Overview","text":"<p>This section will introduce malware analysis fundamentals.</p>"},{"location":"malware/static-basics/","title":"Static Analysis Basics","text":"<p>Foundational static analysis techniques.</p>"},{"location":"malware/tooling/","title":"Tooling Setup","text":"<p>Notes on tools: VM, debuggers, disassemblers.</p>"}]}
